# Simplified-RISC-Processor

Designed a reduced-instruction-set processor where it features a streamlined architecture with a 3-bit opcode 
and a 5-bit operand resulting in a list of 8 instructions and an addressable space of 32 locations, the processor operates 
based on a clock and a reset signal, it outputs a halt signal to indicate the end of execution.
